When did you last use or analyze a UAC bypass? And did you fully understand its internals?

User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature in Windows that limits the set of privileges available to users. And so, bypassing UAC enables threat actors to utilize privileges otherwise not available. A lot of the publicly available UAC bypasses exist, and most of them abuse functionality in COM objects to achieve their goal. However, COM is a largely undocumented part of Windows, making it difficult to truly understand how this process technically works.

In 30 minutes, I will teach you the basics of UAC and COM. Largely visualized, I explain how UAC works, what COM is, and how you can communicate with COM objects. As we progress, I explain in an easy-to-follow way how you can exploit COM objects to bypass UAC.

Lastly, I demo the exploitation of UAC through COM, and I share the code so you can start experimenting with UAC and COM by yourself.
