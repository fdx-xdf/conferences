# Call for Paper

Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) has become an extremely popular attack technique seen in the wild. Even ransomware groups are using it to blind Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR), dump protected credentials from memory, erase their own traces, and all sorts of other juicy things you can do in the Windows kernel. But why bring your own vulnerable driver when you can use those already installed?

In this talk we’ll share our journey of exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability that we found VPN software, used by 40.000 organisations world-wide. After a recap on kernel drivers, we’ll reveal how anyone in the audience can easily find vulnerabilities like these on live systems. Furthermore, we’ll share our abuse path to exploit the vulnerability. We reveal several techniques that you can use to bypass constraints that you usually encounter during kernel driver exploitation. We’ll show you how we applied these techniques to build an exploit that we use in red teaming engagements. Lastly, we demo the exploitation of the vulnerability on a target system, resulting in SYSTEM privileges. 

The talk is accompanied by the first-hand public release of the exploit, in the form of a Cobalt Strike (CS) Beacon Object File (BOF). Additionally, we’ll publish a blog post that includes all technical details.
